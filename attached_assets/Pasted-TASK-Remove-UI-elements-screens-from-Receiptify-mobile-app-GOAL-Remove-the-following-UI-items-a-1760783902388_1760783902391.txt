TASK: Remove UI elements / screens from Receiptify mobile app

GOAL:
Remove the following UI items and screens from the React Native Expo app (frontend only). Do not change backend logic except to remove or guard any front-end calls so the app doesn't crash. Leave backend cleanup (deleting loyalty/subscriptions/warranty endpoints) as TODOs in comments.

REMOVE the following from the app UI (every occurrence across all screens & navigation):

1) Global / Home
- Remove: **Loyal usage**
- Remove: **Eco points**
- Remove: **Dark mode** toggle or icon (anywhere on Home)

2) Scan page (the Scan tab)
- Remove options / buttons:
  - **Capture Receipt**
  - **QR code scan**
  - **Scan Barcode**
- Replace them with a single simplified CTA if desired (keep "Import Receipt" only) — otherwise remove the UI nodes entirely.

3) Receipt / Receipt Detail screen
- Remove: **monthly analytics toggle**
- Remove: **eco points** display/badge

4) More page
- Remove the top bar elements:
  - **$ receipt logo**
  - **"digital receipts"** header text (top bar)
Replace it with the name of the company  Receiptify in capital letters
- Remove entire sections:
  - **Subscription Tracker**
  - **Payment & loyalty cards** (entire section; remove route and navigation to it)

5) Receipts & Warranties area
- Remove: the duplicate **Warranties** section (keep only one, or remove entirely if asked)
- Remove: **Receipt Design** option

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Update navigation so there are no broken links to removed screens.
- Remove imports and components that become unused because of these removals.
- Replace or hide UI elements gracefully (not crash). If removal would leave an empty page, either remove the page entirely or show a minimal placeholder saying "Coming soon" (only if you cannot remove the whole route).
- Add clear commit messages for each change and add TODO comments where backend cleanup would be required (e.g., routes for loyalty, subscriptions, warranties).
- Add a short report at the end listing every file changed and the exact lines or components removed.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Frontend stack: React Native (Expo) + TypeScript.
- Keep changes minimal and isolated to UI/navigation; do not remove database models.
- If a removed section had tests that now fail, update or delete those tests accordingly.

FILES / LOCATIONS TO MODIFY (search-and-edit targets):
(Adapt these file paths to your repo structure; the AI should search by filename patterns and component names.)

- `app/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` (remove loyalty, eco points, dark mode toggles)
- `app/screens/ScanScreen.tsx` (remove Capture Receipt, QR code scan, Scan Barcode UI nodes)
- `app/screens/ReceiptDetail.tsx` (remove monthly analytics toggle & eco points)
- `app/screens/MoreScreen.tsx` OR `app/navigation/MoreStack/*` (remove top bar logo + "digital receipts" text and the Subscription Tracker & Payment & loyalty cards sections)
- `app/screens/WarrantiesScreen.tsx` and any other `Warranties*` screens (remove duplicates or remove routing)
- `app/screens/ReceiptDesign.tsx` (delete or remove link)
- `app/navigation/TabNavigator.tsx` and any other navigation files — remove routes and references to the removed screens
- `app/components/*` (search for components named `EcoPoints`, `LoyaltyUsage`, `DarkModeToggle`, `SubscriptionTracker`, `PaymentCards`, `ReceiptDesignCard`, `CaptureReceiptButton`, `QRCodeScan`, `BarcodeScan`) — remove or refactor them out
- `app/styles/*` (remove unused styles if referenced only by removed components)
- `__tests__/*` (update/delete tests referencing removed components)

CODE ACTIONS (what Replit AI should do exactly)
1. Search the codebase for the following identifiers and remove/hide usages:
   - `EcoPoints`, `ecoPoints`, `LoyalUsage`, `LoyaltyUsage`, `DarkModeToggle`, `CaptureReceipt`, `QRCodeScan`, `BarcodeScan`, `MonthlyAnalyticsToggle`, `SubscriptionTracker`, `PaymentCards`, `PaymentAndLoyalty`, `Warranties`, `ReceiptDesign`, `ReceiptLogo`, `DigitalReceiptsText`

2. For each file where these appear:
   - Remove the import lines.
   - Remove the JSX nodes that render these components or the code block that computes their values.
   - If a screen becomes empty because its primary content was removed, remove the entire screen and the route pointing to it (update navigation), or replace with a small placeholder: `<View style={{padding:16}}><Text>Feature removed</Text></View>`.

3. Update navigation:
   - Remove routes and stack entries that reference deleted screens.
   - Ensure `TabNavigator` reorders or keeps tabs working — no broken links remain.

4. Update top bars and headers:
   - On `MoreScreen` or anywhere the `$ receipt logo` and `digital receipts` text appear in the top bar, remove those elements and restore a plain title only (e.g., `More`).

5. Run a repo-wide linter/fixer:
   - Run TypeScript compiler and ESLint autofix to remove unused imports and highlight any leftover references.
   - If TypeScript errors remain because of backend hooks, guard the calls with safe checks (e.g., `if (someVariable) { ... }`).

6. Tests:
   - Run `npm test`. For failing tests that are about removed UI elements, update or delete them and explain what was removed.

7. Create commits:
   - `chore(ui): remove eco points, loyalty usage and dark mode from Home`
   - `chore(scan): remove capture/QR/barcode scan options and simplify import CTA`
   - `chore(receipt): remove monthly analytics toggle and eco points from receipt detail`
   - `chore(more): remove receipt logo, digital receipts text, subscription tracker, payment & loyalty section`
   - `chore(receipts): remove duplicate warranties & receipt design option`
   - `refactor(nav): remove routes to deleted screens and clean up navigation`

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (what to verify)
1. App builds and runs with `expo start` after changes (no TypeScript compile errors).
2. The following **must NOT appear** anywhere in the app UI:
   - Loyalty usage
   - Eco points
   - Dark mode toggle on Home
   - Capture Receipt / QR code scan / Scan Barcode options on Scan screen
   - Monthly analytics toggle on Receipt screen
   - Eco points on Receipt screen
   - $ receipt logo and "digital receipts" text in More screen top bar
   - Subscription Tracker section in More
   - Payment & loyalty cards section in More
   - Duplicate Warranties sections and Receipt Design option
3. Navigation has no broken links or errors when trying to open removed screens.
4. Unit / integration tests updated to no longer refer to removed components (or removed if not relevant).
5. At the end of the run, print a concise report listing:
   - Files changed
   - Components removed
   - Tests updated/removed
   - Any TODOs left for backend cleanup (with file and line numbers)

OUTPUT (what Replit AI should return in the response)
- A commit summary with the commit messages and files changed.
- The textual report described in Acceptance Criteria step 5.
- If errors occurred (TypeScript/lint/tests), include the error output and suggested fixes.

NOTES / SAFETY
- Do not delete backend DB tables or delete server-side routes. Only remove frontend screens, UI components, and navigation.
- For backend integrations used only by removed UI (e.g., loyalty UI calling `/api/loyalty`), add a TODO comment or a safe guard in the frontend where the call was made.

END.
